    <li>Idea #2: Build a webpage thread that allows poeple to answer the FAQ questions for CST2C and CTD3C.
      <ul><br>
        <li>Audience: STudents of classes, CTD3c and CST2C,  that are in need of help.They can refer to this website allowing themselves to answer their own questions.</li>
<br>

    <li>Idea #3: A webpage that allows AP World History Students to view their vocabulary words in a single page.
      <ul><br>
        <li>Audience: Students of AP World History that need to view their vocabulary words to make their Vocabulary Flash Cards.</li>
<br>
        <li>Brief: They can refer to this webpage whenever they need to view all the vocabulary words and not need to go over each link on Ms.Gray's moodle page.</li>
        <p>This was something i learnt in the process of starting the project and then rejecting it because of poor choice of design, since it did not have a good user-interface: <a href="TROLOLOLO.html"><u>Basic Idea of Vocabulary App</u></a></p>

        <li>Brief: The River Cottage Canteen in Plymouth is looking to update their current double sided lunch menu. With freshly prepared seasonal, local, organic and wild food, on an ever evolving menu, guests can enjoy a taste of River Cottage, served in the relaxed ambience of the restaurant. The client wants their new menu to reflect these qualities. The menu must be double sided as it will be printed as A4 and displayed in menu holders on each table. Due to limitations on printing cost, the client would like to keep the design down to 3 colours maximum. The content for the menu is provided below. Use the inspiration provided to create a fresh, fun and clear menu design.
<br><br>
          Lunch is served from Midday-3.00 pm. Please note these are sample menus, all our produce is locally sourced and seasonal, so the menu is subject to availability and can change.
